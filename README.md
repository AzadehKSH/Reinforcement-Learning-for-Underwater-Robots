# <h1>Reinforcement-Learning-for-Underwater-Robots

The goal of this program is to explore unknown environments with an underwater robot. Various nearby obstacles can influence the agent’s
path. That’s why we want to implement a software that can explore a high percentage of the environment. While driving, the agent follows
a collision-free strategy thus obstacles are avoided. A map is created during the exploration. This map contains sufficient information about the area. After exploring,
a map is drawn.
